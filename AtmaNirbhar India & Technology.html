        <h1>India's latest stride in Technolody Self-dependence</h1>
        <p>Megalithic stone tools, and then microlithic stone tools, bows arrows, spears, daggers, swords, gunpowders, automatic guns, nuclear bombs...Whoever owned the latest weapon technology 
            maintained an upper edge in Balance of Power against the enemy. India having mastered space, atomic, weapons technology thus ensuring peace and stability in the region, is now catching up with the more finer
            things like Infrastructure, semiconductors, software etc. Not that Infrastructure in India is of third world, but in this Globalized world, when comparison between the countries is inevitable, aspirations of 
            people ever higher, there is lot left to be desired. Likewise India in the fields of semiconductors or Software has won big! The kind of development the country has made in promoting the software and software services
            ecosystem, somekind of secondary or tertiary semiconductor work being done in terms of manufacture and assembly of PCBs, the other South Asian countries can not even imagine to do it.

        <p>Nonetheless, having realized the unpredictable nature of World economy, Globalization, Global Supply chain, and also to capture the 21st century, Atmanirbhar tagline for India is more pertinent than ever. 
            The latest developments in Highways, Railways (Semi High Speed Vande Bharat express trains), Metro rail is much needed respite for a typical upward, salaried, middle class professional. 
            Likewise, Indian Government's heavy lifting in setting up a semiconductor foundry aimed at producing silicon ingots and wafers - the raw material for chip manufacturing industry, developing its own mobile operating 
            system (BharOS), 5G tech stack, and ofcourse the revolutionary mobile payment system, will hold the country is good stead in coming decades. 

            This is an introductory blog, and the purpose of this blog is to document India's latest stride in Science, Technology, Engineering fields, all along making Indian Atmanirbhar.
