        <h1>India's latest stride in Technolody Self-dependence</h1>
        <p>Megalithic stone tools, and then microlithic stone tools, bows arrows, spears, daggers, swords, gunpowders, automatic guns, nuclear bombs...Whoever owned the latest weapon technology 
            maintained an upper edge in Balance of Power against the enemy. India having mastered space, atomic, weapons technology thus ensuring peace and stability in the region, is now catching up with the more finer
            things like Infrastructure, semiconductors, software etc. Not that Infrastructure in India is of third world, but in this Globalized world, when comparison between the countries is inevitable, aspirations of 
            people ever higher, there is lot left to be desired. Likewise India in the fields of semiconductors or Software has won big! The kind of development the country has made in promoting the software and software services
            ecosystem, somekind of secondary or tertiary semiconductor work being done in terms of manufacture and assembly of PCBs, the other South Asian countries can not even imagine to do it.
        </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, having realized the unpredictable nature of World economy, Globalization, Global Supply chain, and also to capture the 21st century, Atmanirbhar tagline for India is more pertinent than ever. 
            The latest developments in Highways, Railways (Semi High Speed Vande Bharat express trains), Metro rail is much needed respite for a typical upward, salaried, middle class professional. 
            Likewise, Indian Government's heavy lifting in setting up a semiconductor foundry aimed at producing silicon ingots and wafers - the raw material for chip manufacturing industry, developing its own mobile operating 
            system (BharOS), 5G tech stack, and ofcourse the revolutionary mobile payment system, will hold the country is good stead in coming decades.</p>

        <p> The Vande Bharat Express train is indigeneously developed semi-high speed train with anit-collision <b>Kavach</b> technology. It is equipped with the state of the art amenities. It can cover 800KMs in 8 hours! Impressive! 
            If anyone is a frequent train traveller, then he/she can truly appreciate the welcome change Vande Bharat express will offer. However the aspirational Indian, will not be happy with a comfy train running at 
            150kmph. High speed train, the Shinkansen, will be just the next step. </p>

        <p> The recently announced BharOS, a mobile operating system, an alternative to android and iOS, developed by a startup incubated in IIT Madras campus, if successful, will be a game changer. Try to imagine 
            a mobile phone a few years later, whose hardware including the chipset running it, the mobile parts - from casing, lens, display, the software running it, every damn thing that goes into a mobile, will be 
            made in India! That will be just the triump and pinnacle of computing industry that India can achieve in near future. However, the challenges and steep journey is not be ignored. To begin with, let's first
            setup the goddamn foundry that India has time and again failed to do it. Whatever be the reasons for failure - technology partnership, capital, raw materials, the eco system, it's about time we make up for the loss. </p>


        <p>This is an introductory blog, and the purpose of this blog is to document India's latest stride in Science, Technology, Engineering fields, all along making Indian Atmanirbhar.
